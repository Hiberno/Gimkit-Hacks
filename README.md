### Notes
- Visual answer indicators read the UI to determine the question that is being asked. This means that questions that have identical text can be detected incorrectly and consequently render the wrong answer.
- Not all modes are supported yet _with this script_, however features have already been developed for every mode on Gimkit and will gradually be migrated to this repository

# Usage
The script must be executed before joining the game to receive the game state information. As Gimkit now freezes the WebSocket prototype when the page loads, the script will automatically open a new window with the script executing before the page loads bypassing the freeze.
- Of course, you can try to run the script from [output/bundle.js](output/bundle.js) in DevTools before the WebSocket is frozen
  - However, this will most likely not work because of Josh's anti-tamper measures with object freezing and prototypes

### UserScript (Recommended)
- Pull the script from [output/main-userscript.user.js](output/main-userscript.user.js) and create a new UserScript in Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey or whatever extension you use for userscripts
  - Click [here](https://undercovergoose.github.io/gimkit/output/main-userscript.user.js) to install the script directly into your extension
- The script (should) automatically bypass the WebSocket freeze requiring no new tabs being created

### Bookmarklet (2 Step Process)
- Visit [bookmarklet.html](hiberno.github.io/Gimkit-Hacks/bookmarklet.html) and drag both links to your bookmarks bar
- Navigate to https://gimkit.com/join and press the first script, then press the second script on the tab opened
- You'll know if the script worked if the default right-click context menu doesn't appear

### Auto Updating Bookmarks (CORS Bypass Required):
<details>
  <summary>These scripts require CORS to be disabled in your browser</summary>

> Paste the following into developer console:
```javascript
(async() => {
	const r = await fetch("https://undercovergoose.github.io/gimkit/output/bundle.min.js");
	const t = await r.text();
	const w = window.open(location.href, "_blank");
	w.eval(t);
	w.focus();
})();
```
> or create a bookmarklet with the following url and press to launch:
```javascript
javascript:(async()=>{const r=await fetch("https://undercovergoose.github.io/gimkit/output/bundle.min.js");const t=await r.text();const w=window.open(location.href,"_blank");w.eval(t);w.focus();})();void 0
```

### Running from Source
If you wish to clone the repo and run the script directly from the output folder you can do so by hosting a file server on some port to the repo and changing the URL in the script to `127.0.0.1:8080/output/bundle.min.js` replacing the port with the one you are using.
